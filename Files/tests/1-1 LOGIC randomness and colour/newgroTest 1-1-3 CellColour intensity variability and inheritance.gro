/*To test the inheritance field of randomness, and the intensity (or intensity_params) field of cell_colour
 - "rnd_A" is expected to produce cells with different intensities uniformly distributed in the space
 - "rnd_B" is expected to keep cells with similar intensities spatially close
 - "rnd_C" is expected to produce a single intensity (no variability) or patches if more than one initial cell
The inertia field is set to 1.0 (no resampling) to study the inheritance alone

To test:
 - Use different intensity means and stddev
 - Use different inheritance values
 - Use different initial numbers of cells
