/* To test the link between flux and gene expresison and a threshold. Fields: output, activation, threshold, sgate
The cells act as a sensor of signal (QS receptor). When it is present, the molecule is produced.
The production of the two molecules is equivalent, A uses a flux element and B links the medium condition directly to a operon. Both colours (green and blue) must appear at the same time.

To test:
 - Try different activations and check that the molecule is not produced unless it is higher than the molecule's threshold
 - Try different medium signal thresholds, as the threshold param, as a direct sgate or as a sgate with an intermediate function
 - Try different expression times as a delay
 - Use either the cell_type without "bp_A" with fluxActi higher than molThreshold to test the flux alone or the one with "bp_A" to test how the two contributions are added up to reach a higher molThreshold 
 - Try with and without growth
